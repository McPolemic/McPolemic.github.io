# Good Phone Support Checklist
* Let a customer describe their situation online and offer to call them back when you have a person ready to help them
* If a customer calls and no one's available to answer immediately, offer to call them back
* Never say "Please pay attention to the options, as they've recently changed". You'll never go back and remove that message. If you have people memorizing phone tree options, you have larger problems than the options changing.
* If you play hold music, don't interrupt it unless someone is ready to help or you're offering to call them back.
* Give all operators the tools to transfer calls without losing them
* Provide all operators account information based on the incoming phone number (including recent order history)
