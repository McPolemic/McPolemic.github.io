* After a long break, I'm looking for work again! Or, rather, I've been looking for the past two months. I haven't had much luck getting people to call back and that's a bit nerve-wracking.

* Nika has her second bout of strep throat in two weeks üôÅ. I'm fine with being
  sick but having a sick child seems worse somehow.
* On the plus side, we've both been enjoying
  [F-Zero 99 on the Nintendo Switch][fzero99]. I was a huge F-Zero fan on the
  Super Nintendo and it's been great reliving that in a new context.
* Thanks to a relatively early home release, I was finally able to see Barbie! Liz and Nika had already seen it in theaters but all still enjoyed watching it.
