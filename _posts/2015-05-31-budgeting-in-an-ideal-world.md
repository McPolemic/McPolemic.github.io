# Budgeting in an Ideal World

Last night, during a walk, I had a bit of a Twitter storm.

There's a lot to unpack here, honestly, so let's break it down.

## YNAB

### The Four Rules
1. Give Every Dollar a Job
2. Save for a Rainy Day
3. Roll With the Punches
4. Live on Last Month's Income

As I said, I currently use [YNAB](http://www.ynab.com) for my budgeting. Their [four rules](http://www.youneedabudget.com/method) helped guide me to actually being ahead in payments back when I was excited about managing my money. My wife wasn't as excited, so I would check my various bank sites daily and add in all the transactions one-by-one. YNAB supports OFX import but they try to distance themselves from it. Transactions should be handled manually so they can influence purchasing decisions.

It's a few years later and I'm a bit lazier. I do my transactions once a week. I'm actually putting off dealing with it as I type this. The more manual intervention a process is, the more error-prone it is. I'll make mistakes. I'll put things off. My savings started sliding. I'm still better off than I was with no budget, but I'm not doing as well as I think I could. The bills still get paid, but I don't have the instant feedback needed to influence buying decisions and change behaviors.

I'm also tied to a laptop to do much with the budget. I can enter transactions on an iPhone. I can even reconcile on an iPad. Unfortunately, reconciling is a process that requires having the bank's site open and YNAB, making it either a bizarre juggling act or a multi-device affair. None of them are great answers to a process that is, as I said before, already manual.

## Simple
[Simple](https://www.simple.com) has a very nice [goal system](https://www.simple.com/goals). You put in the priorities and it slowly eeks away from the available balance, slow enough that you don't even notice it missing. The effect is dramatic, though. You'll always have the amount of money you need when you need it, at least for the goals you've set aside. I used it before YNAB and it worked quite well. Transactions are autotagged opening the possibility of budgets automatically pulling from goals in the future. There's a lot to like about this.

There were some problems with this solution, though. You need to manually create a goal for each thing you want to save for. My YNAB budget tracks 33 separate categories, and I imagine that would get unwieldy quick. Worse still, they do not support recurring goals (though a support article says that it's in the works). I'd be putting in 10-20 categories monthly.

Simple only supports one login person per account. They've talked about having support for couples, but it always results in separate accounts. From Simple support:

> We don't have a firm ETA on when they will be available, but our current plan is to roll out the features to support linked accounts as we are able to develop them. We're working really hard to offer instant transfers between Simple customers in the next few months, and then we will introduce data sharing between accounts sometime in the future.

My wife makes a decent income and neither transferring money back and forth or sharing a login sounds great to me. Hopefully it will get better in the future, but I'm stuck for now.

Lastly, you need all of your money in their account. They don't support joint accounts, credit cards, money markets, etc. Credit cards are worthwhile both for point programs and for transactions that may end up being fraudulent (as you're betting with the bank's money rather than yours while you wait for it to be refunded). Money market accounts can gain significant interest over savings accounts. While I enjoy their service, site, and app, I don't really want my budgeting solution to be typed to bank. I want the freedom to go where I feel our money is best held.

Their solution is a good 75% of the way there, but I have to choose their bank in order to take it.

## Mint
I'd like to say I've looked into Mint a great deal. Honestly, after they were bought by Intuit, I haven't been interested in giving them my information. Prior to the buyout, I had large problems with transactions being tagged incorrectly, being missing or repeated, etc.

## Ideal
Finally, on to what I'd like (and the bulk of what I'd tweeted earlier). The older I get, the more comfortable I am with my limitations and fundamental nature. I'd love to say that I'll be an economic model citizen, but things come up and babysitting transactions is a chore. It's a chore that is repetitive and punishes typos or math errors. I recognize a problem suited for a computer when I see one.

I also understand the inherent difficulties in this problem. I suspect YNAB endorses manual entry both for minding transactions and also because pulling financial data from multiple banks is hard. Really hard. Yodlee (who at least used to be the data feed for Mint) has made an entire business out of getting data out of various bank's websites. Screen scraping is a pain, and doing it at scale perfectly may be borderline impossible.

I'd like transactions to be pulled down in near-realtime. Transactions are tagged with a budget category if the payee has been seen before. The money immediately comes out of the budget category and updates the remaining amount.

You never set an amount in a budget category. You set priorities for your money.

> "I need enough money to feed my family."

On a priority of 0-100, this is 100. Phone bills can wait. Eating out can wait. This is mandatory. The budget starts off with reasonable assumptions on what a family (or individual) needs in a month, adjusting as it learns more about a typical month of groceries. Money is taken out of the available pool from the very beginning of the month with adjustments flowing in as the needed amount is tweaked for the user.

> "Here are all my utility bills. I need to pay them on time."

Let's say this has a priority of 99. The family is fed, so now bills must be paid. Bills are input into the system either manually or with URLs, usernames, and password. Bill amounts are pulled regularly to get new bills and ensure that payments were reached on time. The budget is updated with the amounts that have to be paid plus any overhead (if the bill increases like gas or electricity). A payment is sent via the cheapest means, be it the website through their payment services or a bank's online billpay. The amount is pulled out of the available balance as soon as there is enough to cover it to ensure bills get paid.

> "I need to buy birthday gifts for the following ten people this year."

Priority? 50. It will be embarassing to miss a gift, but understandable if your money is tight. Amounts can be manually added, assumed, or inferred based on historical data. If you normally buy your mother a $50 gift, it will start saving for a $50 gift by the time you normally buy it.

> "I want to take a trip to the Bahamas. It costs around $4,000."

This is a priority 25 and has no end date. We'll be skimming the remainder of funds gradually to get this as soon as safely possible. Worse comes to worse, this will be reallocated to pay for higher priority items. At all times, the budget can tell you when it expects you'll have the money, adjusting if it needs to move funds or finds more money.

I really like Simple's "Safe to Spend" concept. It tells you what's in your account that isn't earmarked for a future cause. As much as I like having every dollar have a job, I honestly don't think it's worth the overhead. I want to make sure that my priorities are met and that I'm saving for a rainy day. Most YNABbers that I've talked to have a "catch all" savings category, be it "Rainy Day", "Spending Money", etc. This money doesn't have a job because I don't know when I'll take another vacation, need to go to a funeral



I'm pondering improving budgeting software. @simple is near idea, but doesn't support spouses or shared incomes.
I currently use @ynab, but it's not very intelligent and very manual (intentionally, to be fair).
I want a system that knows my bills, knows my goals, and knows my income. Tell me what I can spend today. Pay my bills when they're due.
Start siphoning money from my immediate awareness and save for rainy days. Get me a month ahead. Six months ahead, even.
Finally, let me easily see how I'm doing. Don't make me load an app every time I want to make a purchase.
I'll file this all away under "Businesses that would be great but unsustainable without being creepy".
